# rollC3
~~a dice engine in C3?~~

So I was going to make my own fancy dice engine in C3, and try to follow the Roll20 rules for rolling, when 
I discovered [**roll**](https://github.com/darkliquid/roll.git) which happened do everything I wanted... in go!  

so NOW this is a port of **roll** to C3, **rollC3**! Currently in progress, does not work at all nor is finished, I am just tired. Will return tomorrow basically.
