# rollC3  [![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg)](https://github.com/Elusive239/rollC3/blob/main/LICENSE) 
So I was going to make my own fancy dice engine in C3, and try to follow the Roll20 rules for rolling, when I discovered [**roll**](https://github.com/darkliquid/roll.git) which happened do everything I wanted... but in go!  

so NOW this is a port of **roll** to C3, **rollC3**!  
It should now be on par with the original go implementation, but there are some portions I feel could do with a minor rewrite.
